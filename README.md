## Development Status

#### Character Tracker - MVP met

Add and remove new characters, track hp, luck and xp.  Figures are updated in real time to Firebase, so multiple users can view changes as they occur.

##### Future Developments

 - Add ability to reduce XP
 - Add dialogue to confirm level up at 5 XP
 - Utilize authorization to allow a user to only be able to edit their own creations
 - Add more detailed info and changeable fields (gear, stats, abilities, status effects)
 - Refactor by splitting into more components

#### Hunter / Keeper Moves - MVP met

Toggle between types of available moves to view the official entry from MotW about how to play and use this move.

##### Future Developments

 - Refactor data structure to utilize database for these entries.  This will allow an admin route that can edit this areas and save changes to the database.
 - Make more attractive interface

#### Knowledgebase - Not yet built

This will be a reference area where players can add and organize information they gather during the campaign.

#### Game Board - In Development

The Game Board currently generates Image layers on a Konva Canvas based on the number of heroes currently in the database and supplies the image URL from the entry.  These layers are drag-and-droppable.

Currently, this component has no connection to the database, so changes to the Canvas are not saved anywhere.

##### Future Development

 - Write onMouseUp event that pushes image coordinates to Firebase
 - Write data structure for holding GameBoard coordinates and any future configurations.
 - Allow user to upload a background image for the stage, providing a board for the image layers.

Since this is based off a proprietary offering, the license is currently restricted.  We'll just say GNU AGPLv3 for now.

I would like this app to be a free companion easily accessible to the public, but I will need to talk to the game creators before making any decisions on my own.

Currently a number of assets were purchased with licensing or attained with free licensing, though future versions will eventually replace these with original assets.
